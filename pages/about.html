          <h1>About Me</h1> 
          <p> 
              Hi All! I am <strong>Sangeetha Ramachandran</strong>. Basically, I belong to Tiruchendur. 
              I have been living in Chennai for 8 years now. I stay here with my family. Apart from my 
              parents,there are two older sisters in my family. Currently, I am exploring myself in 
              Freshworks Software Academy after I have completed my higher secondary from MPB Government 
              Girls Higher Secondary School, Tambaram. I am very interested in the Software field and I
              got an opportunity to join FWSA.I learnt so many things at FWSA and they have also 
              guided me to achieve my goals in the right way. I am also inclined towards creative activities
               such as dancing, drawing and craftwork. I have been a leader for my squad while studying in 
               FWSA.In my free time, I enjoy going out with friends and trying new restaurants to eat. I 
               also enjoy watching humorous movies,listening to music and reading short stories.
